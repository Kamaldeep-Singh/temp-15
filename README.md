Exercise:
Build iPhone Application that uses the Open Weather Map API to find the 
current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc) base on the users 
current GPS location or by a specific city.

Added two projects:
WeatherSDK: Implemented a SDK which can be ported to any app and provides simple API for developers to
fetch weather data.
WeatherApp: As per problem statement, this app uses the WeatherSDK to perform the required functions.

Some more enhancements could be done like saving cities in coredata, reading config from settings.bundle, etc which I can discuss in more detail.
